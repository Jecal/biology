### Quick Recap
- [[Endonucleases]] cut bonds from a specific point on the inside
- [[Exonucleases]] cut bonds from the ends of the DNA/RNA

# Molecular Toolbox
## Restriction Endonucleases
- Bacteria get infected by bacteriophages
- Restriction endonucleases are the "immune system" of the bacteria
### Sticky Ends
- When you have a staggered cut, you get pieces of DNA with sticky ends
- Cuts backbone, break hydrogen bonds, cut backbone
- Results in overhangs, which need to create hydrogen bonds
### Blunt Ends
- When DNA is cut straight, you get two ends with equal ends
- Does not cut hydrogen bonds, only backbone
## Plasmid Vectors
- Small circular pieces of DNA inside bacteria
