# Virus Genome
- Depending on the type of virus, it can have either a:
	- Double-stranded DNA
	- Single-stranded DNA
	- Double-stranded RNA
	- Single-stranded RNA
- The nucleic acid can be in either a single linear form or a circular form
- Each virus has a **"host range"**, which means it can only infect certain types of hosts
- **Zoonotic Virus**, causes same exact disease in different/multiple species
	- Ex: Rabies, both humans and dogs can be infected
	- Ex: Hepatitis, inflammation of liver cells
- A cell's surface receptors will determine if a virus can infect the cell
	- Viruses have **ligands** which will fit into the **receptor**
# Virus Composition
- **Capsid**
	- A protein shell which encloses the viral genome
	- **Capsomeres** are the protein subunits which make up capsids
- **Viral Envelopes**
	- Membranes which cloak their capsids
	- The envelopes are derived from the membrane of the host cell
	- Have viral proteins and **glycoprotein**, a protein with an oligosaccharide attached to it
		- utilized for cell to cell recognition
## How do we get infected repeatedly
- Viruses evolve
	- The ligands of the virus are the ones which change the most
- We have glycoproteins for the previous strain, not the newly evolved strain
# **Bacteriophages**
- Viruses which infect bacteria
- Easy to grow, able to grow them on E.coli
# Lytic Cycle
- Viruses which go through the lytic cycle are called **virulent** viruses
- Steps:
	- Attach to host
	- Inject viral DNA
	- First viral gene expressed is an enzyme which chops up bacterial DNA, using bacterial resources
	- Virus replicates itself and starts assembling itself
	- Eventually causes cell to lyse, or "explode"
# Purpose of Virus
- To exist
- To evolve, in order to keep existing
- Not alive, by definition
	- Not able to reproduce on its own
	- Not able to make its own metabolism
# Lysogenic Cycle
- **Temperate** viruses perform this
	- Don't necessarily destroy the cell
- steps
	- Integrates itself into the host genome
	- **Prophage**, viral virus is in the genome of the bacteria
		- Dormant, viral genome is silent
