# Definition
> Two types of proteins can bind to these sites, activator or silencer proteins:
> **Activators**
> - DNA is bent so that they bind to the transcription factors at the promoter site, activating the RNA polymerase
> **Silencers**
> - Do the opposite of activators, upon bending of DNA and interaction with [[Transcription Factors]], they do not release the RNA polymerase
