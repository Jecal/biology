# Definition
> Facilitates protein synthesis by translating the genetic information encoded in a given mRNA molecule into a specific sequence of amino-acid which eventually forms into a functioning protein. Reads mRNA strands from the 5' to 3'.
# Details
- If the ribosome is creating a polypeptide chain which will fold to become a protein that resides in the cytoplasm, then they do not have to move anywhere
- If the ribosome is creating a polypeptide chain which will fold to become a protein for another organelle or to become secreted, then the chain synthesized goes through the ER
