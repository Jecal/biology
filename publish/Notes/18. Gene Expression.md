# ⚠️ Concept Quiz
***
# How do Organisms Control the Level of Gene Expression?
- Cells should only express necessary genes
- Gene expression takes up a large amount of cellular energy and resources
- Cells live frugal lifestyles, so they conserve energy and resources
- Genes will only be expressed when their products are needed
# How do Prokaryotes Control Gene Expression?
- One singular chromosome, doesn't need a lot of organization
- Bacteria control genes at the transcriptional level
- The gene is either transcribed or not based on certain external stimuli
***
## **Operon**
- Only prokaryote DNA has operons
- A segment of DNA that consists of:
	- A gene or group of genes
	- The promoter of the gene/group of genes
	- A region upstream of the gene called an **operator**
- There are two types of operons:
	- Inducible
	- Repressible
- Operons are either on or off, or activate or inactive
### **Inducible Operon**
- LAC operon is always off
- Lots of lactose presence means increased chances of it binding to the repressor protein, toggling it into an inactive shape
- Decreased lactose concentration means less chance of binding to the repressor protein, not affecting the shape of the repressor protein
### **Repressible Operons**
- TRPR gene, when expressed, produces mRNA, and when translated produces repressor 
- Tryptophan is produced from the gene
- Tryptophan has a chance to attach to the inactive repressor protein, making it active
	- This blocks the production of enzymes necessary for tryptophan synthesis
### **Repressor Protein**
- Have two possible shapes which can be toggled between
	- Active shape of the protein has a high affinity for the operator site of the operon
		- Prevents RNA polymerase from transcribing the gene(s)
		- RNA polymerase is literally physically blocked from moving down the gene
	- Inactive shape of the protein has a low affinity for the operator site of the operon
		- Not able to bind the operator site
- Some molecules can bind to the repressor protein, changing its configuration to an active form
	- Binds to an operator of an operon
- Active form is when operon is in the proper shape which allows it to bind to the operator, preventing RNA polymerase from reading the mRNA
- Operon is always on or off depending on the shape of the repressor protein
	- Concentration of molecule can increase can affect
- A lethal mutation in the operon could prevent repressor protein from being made, or at least in a functional state

# How do Eukaryotes Control the Level of Gene Expression?
- Cells of more complex organisms turn on and off genes based on the functions of the cells
- Eukaryotes control genes at almost every level:
	- Regulation of Chromatin Structure
	- Regulation at the transcriptional level
	- Regulation at a post-transcriptional level
	- Regulation at a translational level
	- Regulation at a post-translational level
## Regulation of Chromatin Structure
- Histone **acetylation** prevents DNA from winding tightly around histones, allowing easy access to promoter sites
	- Deacetylation does the opposite
- DNA **methylation** causes DNA to wind tightly around histones, preventing easy access to gene promoters
	- Demethylation does the opposite
### Histones 
- 
*Complete later*
## Regulation at the Transcriptional Level
- Enhancers (proximal and distal)
- Silencers
- Transcription factors at promoters
	- General transcription factors
	- Specific transcription factors
## Regulation at a Post-Transcriptional Level
- Still in nucleus and is in the form of mRNA
- RNA processing, alternative splicing allows certain proteins to be made instead of others
	- All from the same gene
- mRNA degradation, cytoplasmic nucleases degrade mRNAs so polypeptide synthesis stops
	- More mRNA is made later, if necessary
- 5' caps and 3' tails can be removed or changed and this will prevent translation
## Pre-translational Regulation
- In cytoplasm
- Certain proteins in the cytoplasm can bind to the mRNA's 5' [[UTR]] and prevent ribosomes from binding
- Any change in mRNA shape will prevent ribosome binding
- Decreased length of poly-A tail will prevent translation
### Hairpin Loops
- Ribosome is stalled due to a hairpin loop in mRNA
- mRNA is then degraded by a cluster of exonucleases (exosomes)
## Post-translational Regulation
- Proteins can be ubiquitinzed and degraded in a proteasome
***
# Non-protein-coding RNAs and Gene Regulation
- MicroRNAs or miRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that were
	- Transcribed from DNA
	- Complexed with a number of proteins
	- miRNAs 
***
# Cytoplasmic Determinants
- proteins and transcription factors accumulated in different parts of the cell, and after the cell divides, the two will be different
- Certain things are being accumulated in the cell at one place, and when dividing, the two cells have different transcription factors, therefore expressing different genes
***
# MicroRNA
- large family of RNA
- any kind of small, interfering RNA which interferes with protein synthesis
- can bind with an mRNA and stop ribosomes 
***
Beta galactosidase
- breaks down lactose into galactose and glucose
Permease
- allows lactose to be pulled into the cell
