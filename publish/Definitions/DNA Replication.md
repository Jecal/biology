# General
- Semi-conservative replication
- Results in sister chromatids
- Many enzymes/components involved 
# Step by Step of DNA Replication
1. Points of replication, called origins, are located, and helicase enzymes unwind the double helix at this point, forming replication bubbles
2. The helicase unwinds the double helix, creating replication forks along the way and exposing the strands, making them available for copying
3. Primase synthesizes RNA primers on to both strands, allowing for DNA Polymerase to begin adding nitrogenous bases to the 3' ends
4. Leading and Lagging Strand Synthesis
	1. On the leading strand, replication occurs from the 5' to 3' ends of the strand, allowing for continuous DNA replication
	2. On the lagging strand, replication occurs from the 3' to 5' ends of the strand, causing a necessity for multiple RNA primers to be used, or discontinuous replication
5. RNA primers are then removed by another form of DNA polymerase and replaced with their respective bases
6. DNA ligase joins the okazaki fragments formed on the lagging strand, filling the gaps left by DNA polymerase on the 3' ends
