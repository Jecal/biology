- operon, units of expression
	- found only in prokaryotes
	- purpose is to control gene expression at a transcriptional level
		- either gene is transcribed or not
		- once it's transcribed, it is expressed
- promoter affects many other genes
- polycistronic mRNA, transcript of multiple genes
- operon consists of:
	- promoter
	- operator
	- gene, number varies
- operon is either on or off
- repressor protein
	- 2 possible shapes which are constantly toggled:
		- Active, shape has high affinity for operator site of operon
			- prevents RNA polymerase from transcribing
			- RNA polymerase is physically blocked
		- Inactive, shape has low affinity for operator site of operon
			- not able to bind to operator site
	- Some molecule can bind to the repressor protein, changing it's configuration to an inactive form
	- bind to operator of operon
	- active form is when operon is shape which allows it to bind to the operator
- Operon is always on or off depends on the shape of the repressor protein
	- Concentration of molecule can increase can affect 
- Lethal mutation in lacl operon would prevent repressor protein from being made, or at least in a functional state
- repressible operon
	- trpr gene, when expressed, produces mrna, translated produces repressor protein in it's inactive form
	- tryptophan is produced from the gene
	- tryptophan has a chance to attach to the inactive respressor protein, making it active, blocking the production of eeznymes for trptopahn synthesis
- inducible operon, lac operon is always off
	- lots of lactose presence bind to the repressor protein, putting it into inactive shape
	- decreasing lactose concentration means less binding to repressor protein, not affecting the shape of the repressor protein
- repressible operon, trp operan is always on

# Hox Genes
- when transcribed, creates mRNA
- when mRNA translated, creates protein
- protein is called transcription factor
- Products of hox genes, hox proteins (transcription factors) determine where a certain body part are on an organism
	- Hox A gene makes Hox A transcription factor
	- Without hox protein, cannot transcribe gene where body parts go 
- activate genes where body parts must go
# Hairpin Loop
- affects mRNA
- cell signals 
- enzymes create a hairpin loop in mRNA
- any ribosomes approaching said loop stop and fall off
- separate enzymes disassemble mRNA that was being produced
- proteins and enzymes cause this
# Methylation and Acetylation
- before transcription has occured
# Chain
- methylation and acetylation occur before transcription
- if transcription has occured, transcription factor production is stopped
- if transcription factor production has begun, prevent activator proteins from tapping it
- if that's already done, don't cap or tail
