# Virus Genome
- Depending on the type of virus, it can have either a:
	- Double-stranded [[DNA]]
	- Single-stranded DNA
	- Double-stranded [[RNA]]
	- Single-stranded RNA
- The nucleic acid can be in either a single linear form or a circular form
- Each virus has a **"host range"**, which means it can only infect certain types of hosts
- **Zoonotic Virus**, causes same exact disease in different/multiple species
	- Ex: Rabies, both humans and dogs can be infected
	- Ex: Hepatitis, inflammation of liver cells
- A cell's surface receptors will determine if a virus can infect the cell
	- Viruses have **ligands** which will fit into the **[[Receptor]]**
# Virus Composition
- **[[Capsid]]**
	- A protein shell which encloses the viral genome
	- **[[Capsomeres]]** are the protein subunits which make up capsids
- **[[Viral Envelopes]]**
	- Membranes which cloak their capsids
	- The envelopes are derived from the membrane of the host cell
	- Have viral proteins and **[[Glycoprotein]]**, a protein with an oligosaccharide attached to it
		- utilized for cell to cell recognition
## How do we get infected repeatedly
- Viruses evolve
	- The ligands of the virus are the ones which change the most
- We have glycoproteins for the previous strain, not the newly evolved strain
# **Bacteriophages**
- Viruses which infect bacteria
- Easy to grow, able to grow them on E.coli
# Purpose of Virus
- To exist
- To evolve, in order to keep existing
- Not alive, by definition
	- Not able to reproduce on its own
	- Not able to make its own metabolism
# Lytic Cycle
- **Virulent** viruses go through the lytic cycle
- Order of the lytic cycle:
	1. Virus attaches to its host
	2. Virus injects its viral DNA
	3. The first viral gene expressed is an enzyme which cuts up the host DNA, or bacteria DNA in this case
		- Virus utilizes the host resources in order to carry this process out
	4. Virus replicates itself and starts assembling itself inside the host
	5. Virus eventually causes the cell to lyse, or "explode"
# Lysogenic Cycle
- **Temperate** viruses perform the lysogenic cycle
- **Temperate** viruses perform this
	- Don't necessarily destroy the cell
- steps
	- First gene expressed allows integration into the host genome
	- **Prophage**, viral virus is in the genome of the bacteria
		- *Dormant, viral genome is silent*
		- Every time the bacterial DNA divides, the viral DNA is replicated along with it
			- DNA polymerase does not discriminate; DNA is DNA
		- Can choose to exit the lysogenic cycle and enter the lytic cycle
			- Based off environmental queues
# Animal Viruses
## Why do viruses make us feel terrible?
- Cell is occupied by virus, doing the viruses job
- Cell is no longer doing its job for you, making it harder for your body
## Two ways a cell can die when infected with a virus
- **Apoptosis**, programmed suicide from immune system, causing blebbing and consumption
	- Virus can change or stop the mechanism for apoptosis, preventing death
- **Necrosis**, cell bursts and its contents spread to other cells
## Ebola
- Infects a bunch of different cells, lysing them
- Everything gets liquified, causing hemorrhage everywhere
- **Hemorrhagic Fever**, causes hemorrhaging everywhere
- Shows up, then dissapears
	- No one knows what the reservoir of ebola is, or where it comes from
	- Fruit bats are theorized to be the reservoir
- Some strains can of ebola can be **airborne viruses**
- Most strains of ebola are only transmitted through bodily fluids
## **Chickenpox**
- Remains in your DNA
- Resides in neurons
- Can become activate based off environmental cues, such as stress
# **Retrovirus**
- "retro-" means backwards in science
## **HIV**
- An example of a retrovirus
- **Helper T lyphocyte** cells direct the immune system cells
- HIV removes these helper cells, as their glycoproteins only fit on the receptors of those cells
- HIV+ turns into AIDS
- Steps:
	- HIV cell makes contact with cell, and membrane is fused
	- Capsid is disassembled
	- Reverse transcriptase reads RNA and creates an RNA-DNA hybrid
	- RNA-DNA hybrid turns into double stranded DNA
	- **Integrase** integrates the newly created DNA into the cell DNA
		- Called **provirus**, which integrates its DNA into the cell DNA
		- Cannot be methylated, so it will always be expressed
- Prevents cells from undergoing apoptosis
- 
## Reverse Transcriptase (Retro)
- Normal transcriptions means double stranded DNA gives rise to single stranded RNA 
- Reverse transcriptase gives rise to double stranded DNA from single stranded RNA
**Natural host vs. asymptomatic host**

# Emerging Viruses
- Coronavirus, name of family 
	- Sars-CoV
	- Sars-CoV19
- Bird flu, belongs to influenza family
- Any virus named "H1" belongs to the flu family
- H1N1 was a **chimera** virus
	- Very dangerous, taken the worst/dangerous parts of other viruses and put themselves together
	- Symptoms show up quickly
- Most dangerous viruses in terms of spreading are the viruses which do not have any symptoms but you are still infected
# Viroids
- Naked pieces of DNA and RNA that can infect cells
- Mostly found in plants
# Prions
- Not bacteria, not viruses, not viroids, but they are mis-folded proteins, so wrong shape
- Bump into correctly folded proteins and change their shape
- Cause deficiency in cells
- Particularly isolated in the neuron cells
- Mad Cow Disease is an example of prion
	- Cows would lose ability to balance
	- die faster then prion diseases then of humans
- Prions are translated through food
- CJD, named after doctor who found it, originally found in tribe called the kuru tribe
	- tribal members were losing their minds and the method of transmission was unknown
	- realized it was tied to a funeral ritual, where they would eat a little piece of their brain because they would live on in you (belief)
	- STOP EATING PEOPLE!!!
# Are Viruses Living or Nonliving (they are living)
- Viruses cannot make their own material
- They must hijack and use host cell materials to do normal "living process"

# **Oncoviruses**
- Cancer causing virus
- HPV is an oncovirus
- Incorporate DNA into genome
	- Could kill a gene, making it defunct
	- Could kill the p53 gene, tumor suppressor
		- Tumor suppressor inhibit cell division, and promote apoptosis
	- Has the potential to disable important genes
- Could cause cancer in the future
## Hepatitis
- A is transmitted through bad water
- B & C is transmitted through bodily fluids, or anything that could 
## Karposi's Sarcoma
- Causes sarcoma, cancer of connected tissue
## Epstein-Barr
- integrates into certain places
- end up with lymphoma
# Proto-Oncogenes
- proto means before, first, early
- genes which could become oncogenes
	- Virus can incorporate into the middle of a gene
	- Virus can incorporate it's genome next to the proto-oncogene, you can develop cancer
- necessary for our survivals
- viruses have really powerful promoters
	- they want their gene to be expressed more than your gene
	- they stick it next to your protooncogene
		- if virus disrupts the gene, the virus will be expressed, and the gene will also be expressed even more because of the viral promoter
- Viral DNA integration and random mutations can make oncogenes
# Oncogenes
- cancer causing genes
- usually of genes that need controlled expression
	- telomerase, lengthens telomeres
	- cyclin, needs to be in control
# Bacteria
## The New System
- Adds a level above Kingdom called Domain
- There are three domains - two of which contain prokaryotes and one contains eukaryotes
- All of bacterial infections are caused by the bacteria domain
- **Archea** are old bacteria
	- **Extremophiles**, live in weird places
	- Many are killed in contact with oxygen
## Prokaryotes
- Have cell walls made out of peptidoglycans
- One chromosome
	- Single double helix DNA
	- Circular DNA
- One end of the DNA is attached to the membrane
- The region where DNA is hooked to the membrane is called the nucleoid
- Have no organelles except their own form of ribosomes
	- Smaller than eukaryotic ribosomes
- Have a flagella made for movement
	- Made out of tubulin
	- Has a membrane in eukaryote
	- Naked in bacteria, membrane does not cover flagellum
		- Made out of flagellum
> Chloroplasts and eukaryotes have their own ribosomes

# 4 categories of prokaryotes based on their method of obtaining energy and carbon
- Photoautotrophs
	- Harness light to synthesize organic compounds from carbon dioxide
- Chemoautrophs
	- Use CO2 to synthesize organic compounds
	- Don't use light energy
	- Obtain energy by oxidizing inorganic substances such as H2s and NH3
- Photoheterotrophs
	- Use light energy
	- Cannot use carbon dioxide to make sugar
- Chemoheterotrophs
	- All animals are chemoheterotrophs
	- Consume organic molecules for both energy and carbon
## Metabolism and Oxygen
- Obligate aerobes, absolutely must have O2
- Facultative anaerobes, aerobic if O2 is present, ferment if it is not
- Obligate anaerobes, hate O2 and die if exposed to it
## Gram Staining [rev]
- Gram positive picks up purple
- Gram negative picks up orange

***

# Three ways bacteria can get new DNA
- Transformation
	- Bacteria picks up plasmid from environment
- Conjugation
	- F+ gene must be present
- Transduction
	- Virus screws up and transports DNA from one bacterium to another
# Archaebacteria
- Halophiles, love salty environments
- Thermoacidophiles, or extreme thermophiles, love heat and/or acidity
- Methanogens, hate O2, make CH4
# The Role of Prokaryotes
- #1 role, they are **decomposers**
	- Saprobes, bacterial decomposer
	- Fungi are also decomposers, but eukaryotic
	- Necessary to the cycle
- **Symbiotic**
	- Mutualism, both benefit
	- Commensalism, one benefits, the other is unaffected
	- Parasitism, one benefits, the other is harmed
- **Pathogenic**, causes disesases
	- Opportunistic, normal residents in/or another organism cause disease when the organism's "guard is down" (due to illness)
# How do we get sick from bacteria?
- THEY MAKE POISONS!!!!!! (OMG)
- **Exotcins**, protein toxins secreted by certain bacteria that can make one ill. Only produced when the bacteria is alive
	- Can be prevented by boiling
- **Endotoxins**, lipopolysaccharide complexes associated with the outer membrance of **Gram-negative** bacteria such as E. coli, **released on bacterial death and in part during growth**
