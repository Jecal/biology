# Virus Genome
- Depending on the type of virus, it can have either a:
	- Double-stranded DNA
	- Single-stranded DNA
	- Double-stranded RNA
	- Single-stranded RNA
- The nucleic acid can be in either a single linear form or a circular form
- Each virus has a **"host range"**, which means it can only infect certain types of hosts
- **Zoonotic Virus**, causes same exact disease in different/multiple species
	- Ex: Rabies, both humans and dogs can be infected
	- Ex: Hepatitis, inflammation of liver cells
- A cell's surface receptors will determine if a virus can infect the cell
	- Viruses have **ligands** which will fit into the **[[Receptor]]**
# Virus Composition
- **[[Capsid]]**
	- A protein shell which encloses the viral genome
	- **[[Capsomeres]]** are the protein subunits which make up capsids
- **[[Viral Envelopes]]**
	- Membranes which cloak their capsids
	- The envelopes are derived from the membrane of the host cell
	- Have viral proteins and **[[Glycoprotein]]**, a protein with an oligosaccharide attached to it
		- utilized for cell to cell recognition
## How do we get infected repeatedly
- Viruses evolve
	- The ligands of the virus are the ones which change the most
- We have glycoproteins for the previous strain, not the newly evolved strain
# **Bacteriophages**
- Viruses which infect bacteria
- Easy to grow, able to grow them on E.coli
# Purpose of Virus
- To exist
- To evolve, in order to keep existing
- Not alive, by definition
	- Not able to reproduce on its own
	- Not able to make its own metabolism
# Lytic Cycle
- Viruses which go through the lytic cycle are called **virulent** viruses
- Steps:
	- Attach to host
	- Inject viral DNA
	- **First viral gene expressed** is an enzyme which chops up bacterial DNA, using bacterial resources
	- Virus replicates itself and starts assembling itself
	- Eventually causes cell to lyse, or "explode"
> Edit lytic cycle to be in chronological step order
# Lysogenic Cycle
- **Temperate** viruses perform this
	- Don't necessarily destroy the cell
- steps
	- First gene expressed allows integration into the host genome
	- **Prophage**, viral virus is in the genome of the bacteria
		- *Dormant, viral genome is silent*
		- Every time the bacterial DNA divides, the viral DNA is replicated along with it
			- DNA polymerase does not discriminate; DNA is DNA
		- Can choose to exit the lysogenic cycle and enter the lytic cycle
			- Based off environmental queues
## Ebola
- Infects a bunch of different cells, lysing them
- Everything gets liquified, causing hemorrhage everywhere
- **Hemorrhagic Fever**, causes hemorrhaging everywhere
## Chickenpox
- Remains in your DNA
- Resides in neurons
- Can become activate based off environmental cues, such as stress
# Animal Viruses
## Why do viruses make us feel terrible?
- Cell is occupied by virus, doing the viruses job
- Cell is no longer doing its job for you, making it harder for your body
## Two ways a cell can die when infected with a virus
- **Apoptosis**, programmed suicide from immune system, causing blebbing and consumption
	- Virus can change or stop the mechanism for apoptosis, preventing death
- **Necrosis**, cell bursts and its contents spread to other cells
# Retrovirus
- "retro-" means backwards in science
## HIV
- An example of a retrovirus
- Helper T lyphocyte cells direct the immune system cells
- HIV removes these helper cells, as their glycoproteins only fit on the receptors of those cells
- HIV+ turns into AIDS
- Steps:
	- HIV cell makes contact with cell, and membrane is fused
	- Capsid is disassembled
	- Reverse transcriptase reads RNA and creates an RNA-DNA hybrid
	- RNA-DNA hybrid turns into double stranded DNA
	- **Integrase** integrates the newly created DNA into the cell DNA
		- Called **provirus**, which integrates its DNA into the cell DNA
		- Cannot be methylated, so it will always be expressed
- Prevents cells from undergoing apoptosis
## Reverse Transcriptase (Retro)
- Normal transcriptions means double stranded DNA gives rise to single stranded RNA 
- Reverse transcriptase gives rise to double stranded DNA from single stranded RNA
**Natural host vs. asymptomatic host**
