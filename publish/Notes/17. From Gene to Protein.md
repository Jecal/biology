# Concept
- Genes are a segment of DNA
- Genes can encode for a protein
- DNA cannot just be replicated and sent outside of the nucleus because of the threat of destruction from enzymes in the cytoplasm
- The gene must take upon another form to be able to exit the nucleus, a process called transcription
- Transcription results in the mRNA for a protein
- The mRNA must be prepared, capped and tailed, before it can be sent outside the nucleus
- Once outside the nucleus, ribosomes attach the mRNA and start to translate the strand into a polypeptide chain
- The polypeptide chain is then folded, resulting in a functional protein
# Metaphorical Explanation
- The nucleus contains DNA, or the recipe book
- The recipes of the book cannot be torn out
- A recipe is found in the book, and is then copied
- The copied recipe is prepared for use
- The recipe is given to the chef, and the chef must read the recipe
- The chef reads the recipe and begins to create the meal, or protein
- The chef's assistants bring ingredients, and the chef takes what they need in order to create the meal
- The end result is a meal, or a polypeptide chain, which must then be folded to become a protein
