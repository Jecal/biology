# Definition
> Non-coding DNA added on to the coding DNA in order to compensate for the shortening of a strand every single time it is replicated
# Origins
- RNA primers at the 5' ends of both DNA strands are removed
- DNA polymerase cannot synthesize nitrogenous bases on to the 5' ends to replace the recently removed RNA primers
- DNA polymerase has no response to this
- Every single time DNA is replicated, the lagging strand is shortened
- In response to this, coding DNA is found at the center of a strand, and non-coding DNA is found at the ends of the strand
- This prevents coding DNA from being removed
