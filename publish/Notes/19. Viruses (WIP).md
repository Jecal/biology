# Virus Genome
- Depending on the type of virus, it can have either a:
	- Double-stranded DNA
	- Single-stranded DNA
	- Double-stranded RNA
	- Single-stranded RNA
- The nucleic acid can be in either a single linear form or a circular form
- Each virus has a **"host range"**, which means it can only infect certain types of hosts
- **Zoonotic Virus**, causes same exact disease in different/multiple species
	- Ex: Rabies, both humans and dogs can be infected
	- Ex: Hepatitis, inflammation of liver cells
- A cell's surface receptors will determine if a virus can infect the cell
	- Viruses have **ligands** which will fit into the **[[Receptor]]**
# Virus Composition
- **[[Capsid]]**
	- A protein shell which encloses the viral genome
	- **[[Capsomeres]]** are the protein subunits which make up capsids
- **[[Viral Envelopes]]**
	- Membranes which cloak their capsids
	- The envelopes are derived from the membrane of the host cell
	- Have viral proteins and **[[Glycoprotein]]**, a protein with an oligosaccharide attached to it
		- utilized for cell to cell recognition
## How do we get infected repeatedly
- Viruses evolve
	- The ligands of the virus are the ones which change the most
- We have glycoproteins for the previous strain, not the newly evolved strain
# **Bacteriophages**
- Viruses which infect bacteria
- Easy to grow, able to grow them on E.coli
# Purpose of Virus
- To exist
- To evolve, in order to keep existing
- Not alive, by definition
	- Not able to reproduce on its own
	- Not able to make its own metabolism
# Lytic Cycle
- **Virulent** viruses go through the lytic cycle
- Order of the lytic cycle:
	1. Virus attaches to its host
	2. Virus injects its viral DNA
	3. The first viral gene expressed is an enzyme which cuts up the host DNA, or bacteria DNA in this case
		- Virus utilizes the host resources in order to carry this process out
	4. Virus replicates itself and starts assembling itself inside the host
	5. Virus eventually causes the cell to lyse, or "explode"
# Lysogenic Cycle
- **Temperate** viruses perform the lysogenic cycle
- **Temperate** viruses perform this
	- Don't necessarily destroy the cell
- steps
	- First gene expressed allows integration into the host genome
	- **Prophage**, viral virus is in the genome of the bacteria
		- *Dormant, viral genome is silent*
		- Every time the bacterial DNA divides, the viral DNA is replicated along with it
			- DNA polymerase does not discriminate; DNA is DNA
		- Can choose to exit the lysogenic cycle and enter the lytic cycle
			- Based off environmental queues
# Animal Viruses
## Why do viruses make us feel terrible?
- Cell is occupied by virus, doing the viruses job
- Cell is no longer doing its job for you, making it harder for your body
## Two ways a cell can die when infected with a virus
- **Apoptosis**, programmed suicide from immune system, causing blebbing and consumption
	- Virus can change or stop the mechanism for apoptosis, preventing death
- **Necrosis**, cell bursts and its contents spread to other cells
## Ebola
- Infects a bunch of different cells, lysing them
- Everything gets liquified, causing hemorrhage everywhere
- **Hemorrhagic Fever**, causes hemorrhaging everywhere
- Shows up, then dissapears
	- No one knows what the reservoir of ebola is, or where it comes from
	- Fruit bats are theorized to be the reservoir
- Some strains can of ebola can be **airborne viruses**
- Most strains of ebola are only transmitted through bodily fluids
## **Chickenpox**
- Remains in your DNA
- Resides in neurons
- Can become activate based off environmental cues, such as stress
# **Retrovirus**
- "retro-" means backwards in science
## **HIV**
- An example of a retrovirus
- **Helper T lyphocyte** cells direct the immune system cells
- HIV removes these helper cells, as their glycoproteins only fit on the receptors of those cells
- HIV+ turns into AIDS
- Steps:
	- HIV cell makes contact with cell, and membrane is fused
	- Capsid is disassembled
	- Reverse transcriptase reads RNA and creates an RNA-DNA hybrid
	- RNA-DNA hybrid turns into double stranded DNA
	- **Integrase** integrates the newly created DNA into the cell DNA
		- Called **provirus**, which integrates its DNA into the cell DNA
		- Cannot be methylated, so it will always be expressed
- Prevents cells from undergoing apoptosis
- 
## Reverse Transcriptase (Retro)
- Normal transcriptions means double stranded DNA gives rise to single stranded RNA 
- Reverse transcriptase gives rise to double stranded DNA from single stranded RNA
**Natural host vs. asymptomatic host**

# Emerging Viruses
- Coronavirus, name of family 
	- Sars-CoV
	- Sars-CoV19
- Bird flu, belongs to influenza family
- Any virus named "H1" belongs to the flu family
- H1N1 was a **chimera** virus
	- Very dangerous, taken the worst/dangerous parts of other viruses and put themselves together
	- Symptoms show up quickly
- Most dangerous viruses in terms of spreading are the viruses which do not have any symptoms but you are still infected
# Viroids
- Naked pieces of DNA and RNA that can infect cells
- Mostly found in plants
# Prions
- Not bacteria, not viruses, not viroids, but they are mis-folded proteins, so wrong shape
- Bump into correctly folded proteins and change their shape
- Cause deficiency in cells
- Particularly isolated in the neuron cells
- Mad Cow Disease is an example of prion
	- Cows would lose ability to balance
	- die faster then prion diseases then of humans
- Prions are translated through food
- CJD, named after doctor who found it, originally found in tribe called the kuru tribe
	- tribal members were losing their minds and the method of transmission was unknown
	- realized it was tied to a funeral ritual, where they would eat a little piece of their brain because they would live on in you (belief)
	- STOP EATING PEOPLE!!!
# Are Viruses Living or Nonliving (they are living)
- Viruses cannot make their own material
- They must hijack and use host cell materials to do normal "living process"
# **Oncoviruses**
- Cancer causing virus
- HPV is an oncovirus
