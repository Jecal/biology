# Definition
> Refers to the non-standard pairing between the third nucleotide of a [[Codon]] and it's [[Anti-codon]]. Allows some [[tRNA]] molecules to recognize multiple codons which code for the same amino acid, increasing the efficiency of protein synthesis and **minimizing the number of tRNA required in the cell, speeding up translation.**
