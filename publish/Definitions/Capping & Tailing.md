# Definition
> The process by which a 7-methylguanosine cap is added to the 5' end of the mRNA and a polyadenylate, or poly-a, tail is added to the 3' end
# Purposes
- **Cap**: prevents the mRNA from being degraded when outside the nucleus
- **Tail**: provides time for the mRNA to be translated by ribosomes when it exits the nucleus, as an exonuclease actively consumes the tail
# Components
- [[Pre-mRNA]]
