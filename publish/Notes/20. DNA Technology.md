### Quick Recap
- [[Endonucleases]] cut bonds from a specific point on the inside
- [[Exonucleases]] cut bonds from the ends of the DNA/RNA

# Molecular Toolbox
## Restriction Endonucleases
- Bacteria get infected by bacteriophages
- Restriction endonucleases are the "immune system" of the bacteria
### Sticky Ends
- When you have a staggered cut, you get pieces of DNA with sticky ends
- Cuts backbone, break hydrogen bonds, cut backbone
- Results in overhangs, which need to create hydrogen bonds
### Blunt Ends
- When DNA is cut straight, you get two ends with equal ends
- Does not cut hydrogen bonds, only backbone
## Plasmid Vectors
- Small circular pieces of DNA inside bacteria

> **Insert Gene of Interest in the human genome into a plasmid, which would then be put into an e.coli, which then the respective protein from the human genome would be made by the e.coli**

### Whatever this is called
- Gene of interest in human genome produces the protein insulin
- Protein is cut from genome, along with it's [[Restriction Sites]] and placed into a plasmid
- Plasmid would then be picked up by an e.coli, which would then start producing insulin
- The [[AMP R gene]] weeds out bacteria that did not pick up the plasmid
- The [[pBLU]] gene would also be paired with the AMP R gene so that whichever e.coli which had the AMP R gene and the insulin gene would proceed to be blue
- Same endonuclease which cut the plasmid to have sticky ends, will also cut the foreign DNA so that it matches
### In the case of blunt ends
- lack of specificity, any portion of DNA can fit into the plasmid

## Gel Electrophoresis
- A procedure which uses an electric current to separate DNA fragments according to their size
- Utilizes two things
	- Charge, DNA is negative by default
	- Size
- **Agarose Gel** is a much finer quality agar
### Procedure
- Shorter lengths of DNA move through the agarose at a faster pace then the longer ones
- Moves from the negative to positive end of the box
- When power supply is off, stained DNA bands will appear on the agarose
	- Bands represent thousands of copies of the DNA with the same size
- Ladder DNA is input into one of the wells to have a sort metric

# PCR
- Polymerase Chain Reaction
- Used to amplify DNA or RNA samples
	- Amplify means copying
- Process
	- DNA double strand is denaturated at 95C, separation via heat
	- DNA is temperature stable, so as soon as it cools down it comes back together
	- DNA polymerase is a protein, which means it will denature and not come back together
	- Utilize Thermus Aquaticus, type of archea bacteria
		- Has Taq. polymerase
	- 2 DNA primers used
		- Forward
		- Reverse
- PCR Process
	- Raise temperature to Denature DNA
	- Anneal primers, opposite of denaturing
	- Taq Pol-DNA synthesis
